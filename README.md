## Summary & Motivation
This web extension was thought to make your calls easier, more fluent and
productive without the overhead of thinking about that.

Working on a scrum basis you several times are wondering who will be the next
mate to share the updates with the team. It can be an embarassing moment or even
a time loss.

WhosNext tries to minimize this overhead during
[Hangouts Meet](https://gsuite.google.com/products/meet/) calls by providing
you the next speaker as well as showing who already spoke in case you came a
few minutes later to the party.

## How does it work?
Take a look to the demo video to witness a real scenario and understand how to use it.

<div style="width: 500px; margin-top: 25px; text-align: center;">

</div>

This is an overview of the architecture. A more detailed version will be published asap.
